# Ballon Simulator

# A simple game where you control the balloon using the space bar, with the objective of landing it on the designated area. During the flight, monitor the temperature, gas levels, and steer clear of the beacon.

# Run the game by downloading all files and executing the HTML file

# The game was designed in JavaScript to test image movement on the canvas (with the image in the background), allow keyboard controls, evaluate sound effects, and simulate gravity.
